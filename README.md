# Definition of a local Chapter
A local on-ground community - preferably covering a city (or in some cases, a handful of cities depending on the geography)  - brought together under the flag of PWiC with the common and focused mission of growing, learning and connecting women and other under-represented groups is termed as a local Chapter. This is the basic building block that makes up the foundation of the whole organization.

Each local chapter is internally made up of a strong, committed and passionate team and team leader(s) with a community of people behind them. It should have a well-defined mission of their own, plus short term and long term goals and plans contributing to the broader vision of Pakistani Women in Computing (in some way).

# pwic-chapter-guidelines
Repository to describe in detail about the concept of local chapters in the Pakistani Women in Computing (PWiC) organization. Local chapter make up the very foundation of this organization and we deem them really crucial in the success of this organizationâ€™s future. Hence, it is really important to clearly define the guidelines, expectations and workflows especially as we plan to grow aggressively moving forward. 

## Why do we need these guidelines?
Here are some of the reasons we needed this handbook for:
1. We need a scalable way where we can build on top of each other with the least effort and overhead when forming new chapters
2. We take help from existing communities and material wherever we can (without reinventing the wheel every time) - for operations, organization etc
3. We are aligned in the overall direction and vision when it comes to running our local chapters - with small deviances in how we operate locally given the social dynamics of the locality
4. We are aligned on the basic expectations of when a chapter or team is not functioning as expected
5. We build a nice support system and know how to take help from each other when needed

## Who is it for?
This guide is relevant:
* (Especially) for the existing and upcoming Chapter leads (more on the definition of a Chapter lead later)
* For teams that form-up local chapters
* For anyone part of the PWiC team 
* For anyone whole belongs/associates themselves to the PWiC community

## What can this be used for?
This guide can be be used for:
* Guidelines and expectations when forming a new chapter
  * Handbooks will be provided to put the initial setup in place
* Guidelines and expectations when operating a local chapter 
  * Handbooks will be provided for ideas on types of events, workshops etc that can he held
* Guidelines and expectation when to terminate a given chapter 
  * A streamlined workflow will be given so we are all aligned on when a chapter is no longer needed/not healthy enough to operate anymore
* Guidelines and expectations on communication and cross-collaboration with:
  * Other local chapters
  * With PWiC Global
